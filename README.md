HDL Digital Design
===========
This repo consists of labs exercises from HDL Digital Design 2023 at HUST by Mr. Minh and related document. In this course, we will use Verilog to implement a Digital ciruit by FPGA.

Tools and related resources:

- **FPGA Board:** DE2-115-Board
- **Stimulator:** Questasim
- **Synthesis and FPGA Implement:** Quartus

## List of Labs
1. Code, simulate and implement to FPGA kit a BIN to 7seg decoder to control 4 7-seg LEDs by 16 bit input signal from switches
2. Code verilog design and testbench file then simulate for the following module (see [Lab2 report](./Lab2/Lab2_Report.pdf) for details)
   - ALU 32 bits support 8 operations
   - Majority module for 32 bits
   - CRA 8 bits
3. Code, simulate and implement a century digital clock (displayed by 7-seg LEDs)
4. Code, simulate and implement a ***Traffic Light Highway - Country Control System*** (see [Lab4 report](./Lab4/Lab4_Report.pdf) for details)
